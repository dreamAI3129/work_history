- https://preply.com
This site is online language learning platform.
It developed by Next.js and React.
I was involved in building this webapp as a full-stack developer.
Initially, I used Angular + Springboot, but when it came to handling multiple logins simultaneously, I realized that NodeJS was the best solution to solve this problem.
I also decided to use Reactjs instead of Angular because of React's Virtual Dom feature, which can perform even in applications with a lot of data. So we used Nextjs that is a React framework that is designed for building server-rendered web applications.
As a database, We used postgreSQL.

-hopcar.net
This is my latest project using mern stack.
This is car booking site similar to blablacar.
In this project, the most difficult thing was to optimize project about a lot of users.
And chatting functionality was also a bit difficult.
I used socket.io module for this.
I hosted this site using godaddy vps.
I can give you admin credentials if you want.
And then, you can see admin dashboard.

hello.
My name is Rafael and I can help you as an expert.

With a strong background in artificial intelligence and a passion for financial markets, I am confident that I can develop a trading bot that utilizes artificial intelligence to detect market trends and suggest efficient and timely trades.

My experience with AI and machine learning has equipped me with the necessary skills to constantly review market data and make informed decisions on when to buy or sell stocks. I am adept at designing algorithms that can be customized to fit the specific parameters and preferences of individual investors, minimizing human intervention in the trading process.

I have developed a Bitcoin trading bot.

This bot notifies me when a certain pattern is completed.
When the same image appears on all three charts, that chart becomes the final pattern.
It notifies me when there are three greens and three reds.(add attachment)
The bot running times are 15 minutes, 1 hour, and 6 hours.
The bot's job is to monitor this pattern and send us an alert when it appears.
The customer decides to sell or buy based on the bot's alerts.

I am very interested in your project and am confident that can do it.

If you work with me, you will receive daily report.

Thank you.

3. Keras: Keras is a high-level neural network library written in Python that runs on top of TensorFlow or Theano. It provides a simple and intuitive API for building and training deep learning models, making it ideal for beginners and experts alike. Keras supports a wide range of neural network architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and autoencoders.

4. Scikit-learn: Scikit-learn is a Python library for machine learning that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. It includes a wide range of algorithms for supervised and unsupervised learning, such as classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. Scikit-learn also provides tools for model selection, evaluation, and preprocessing.

5. Pandas: Pandas is a Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures for efficiently storing and manipulating large datasets, as well as tools for data cleaning, merging, and reshaping. Pandas is commonly used in combination with other libraries such as Scikit-learn and TensorFlow for data preprocessing and analysis.

6. NumPy: NumPy is a Python library for numerical computing that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. It includes a wide range of mathematical functions for linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and random number generation. NumPy is widely used in scientific computing and machine learning applications.

7. OpenCV: OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. It provides tools for image processing, feature detection, object recognition, and more. OpenCV is commonly used in computer vision applications such as face recognition, object tracking, and augmented reality.

These are just a few examples of the many libraries and frameworks available for machine learning and deep learning development. The choice of tool depends on the specific needs of the project and the developer's experience with the tools.

-Ecommerce previous work
In the previous e-commerce website development project, I have previous experience working on a website development project.
The most challenging aspect was implementing a seamless and secure payment gateway. To overcome this challenge, I conducted thorough research and selected a reliable payment gateway provider that aligned with the client's requirements. I then integrated the chosen payment gateway into the website, ensuring proper encryption and data protection measures were in place. Through rigorous testing and collaboration with the client, we successfully achieved a smooth and secure payment process, enhancing the overall user experience. This experience has equipped me with valuable insights into overcoming challenges related to payment gateway integration in e-commerce projects.
















----------------------QA--------------------------------
Describe your approach to testing and improving QA

When it comes to testing and improving quality assurance (QA), my approach involves a comprehensive and iterative process. Here is an example of how I would approach testing and improving QA:

1. Test Planning: I start by creating a detailed test plan that outlines the scope, objectives, and test cases for the project. This plan serves as a roadmap for testing activities.

2. Test Case Development: I develop test cases based on functional and non-functional requirements, covering different scenarios and edge cases. These test cases are designed to ensure maximum coverage and identify potential issues.

3. Test Execution: I execute the test cases systematically, following the test plan. I record the results, including any defects or issues encountered during testing, in a structured manner.

4. Defect Tracking: I use a defect tracking system to log and track any identified issues. Each issue is categorized based on severity and priority, allowing for efficient resolution.

5. Root Cause Analysis: When issues are identified, I conduct thorough root cause analysis to understand the underlying reasons. This helps in addressing the root causes rather than just fixing the symptoms.

6. Continuous Improvement: I believe in continuous improvement of QA processes. I review test results, identify patterns, and analyze trends to identify areas for improvement. This may involve refining test cases, enhancing test coverage, or implementing new testing techniques.

7. Collaboration: I actively collaborate with developers, designers, and stakeholders throughout the testing process. This ensures clear communication, shared understanding of requirements, and timely resolution of issues.

8. Automation: Wherever applicable, I leverage automation tools and frameworks to streamline repetitive testing tasks and increase efficiency. This allows for faster and more frequent testing cycles.

9. Feedback Loop: I actively seek feedback from users, stakeholders, and team members to gather insights on usability, performance, and overall user experience. This feedback helps in identifying areas that require further improvement.

10. Documentation: Throughout the testing process, I maintain detailed documentation of test plans, test cases, test results, and any changes made. This documentation serves as a reference for future testing and ensures knowledge transfer within the team.

By following this approach, I aim to continuously enhance the quality assurance process, identify potential issues early on, and deliver a robust and reliable product.
